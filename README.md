# Release Watcher

A lightweight tool to fetch the latest release version from GitHub repositories. It prints the project name, URL to the release, and the most recent version tag in a clean format. Perfect for quick checks, scripts, or staying up to date with your dependencies.

The release-watcher tool is a single project designed to monitor GitHub releases for a list of  repositories. When run, the tool uses HTTP requests to query the GitHub Releases API, retrieving release information for each project. The ressults are compared to previously stored data, and any changes are displayed in a human-readable format.

## Apps and Versions (generated by this project)

The app queries the GitHub Releases API for the latest releases of the specified repositories. E.g. <https://api.github.com/repos/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/latest>. That means pre-releases are not included in the output.

The versions overview for the [list of repos as specified in this repository](components/taskfile.yml) is written to [`components/work/versions.md`](components/work/versions.md).

The [DevContainer Configuration](.devcontainer/Dockerfile) from this repository provides a ready-to-use environment with all necessary tools pre-installed. You can use it to run the playbook without additional setup.

## How to use with `task`

To run the app locally, simply run `task run` from [components/taskfile.yml](components/taskfile.yml) - e.g. `cd components && task run`.

The tool prints the version information to the console and writes it to a markdown file in the `components/work` directory.

```

When running release-watcher, you will be asked to log in to GitHub using the GitHub CLI. This is necessary to access the GitHub API without running into rate limits. release-watcher uses the GitHub CLI for the login, so whether credentials are stored in the local cache or not is up to the GitHub CLI.

### Prerequisites when running with `task`

- Ensure you have [Task](https://taskfile.dev) installed on your system.
- Ensure you have [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) installed on your system. This tool is mandatory because all GitHub API calls are made using the GitHub CLI.
- Ensure you have [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq) installed on your system. This tool is used to parse the JSON output from the GitHub API.
- Ensure you have `diff` installed on your system. This tool is used to compare files (in this case the files containing the previous and current versions of the releases). Normally the tool is shipped with Ubuntu.

## :zap: Baseline for Version Comparison

To be able to compare versions, the tool needs to have a baseline to compare against. The initial run will mark every repository as "updated" because there is no previous version to compare against. From the second run on, the tool will compare the current version with the previous version and only print the repositories that have changed. This means the `components/work/versions.md` file should be persistent somehow (e.g. in a Git Repository) to act as the baseline and keep the previous versions available for comparison.

## Risks and Technical Debts

All issues labeled as `risk` (= some sort of risk or a technical debt) or `security` (= disclosed security issues - e.g. CVEs) [are tracked as GitHub issue](https://github.com/sommerfeld-io/release-watcher/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Asecurity%2Crisk+is%3Aopen) and carry the respective label.
